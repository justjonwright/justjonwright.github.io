  <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
  <h2>Verse 5 - Deep waters are the will in the heart of a man / Yet a man of insight will draw it out</h2>
  <p>One of the many differences between a man and a child is the lack of naïveté. A child cannot tell the difference between a friendly neighbor providing candy on October 31st and the perverse stranger offering free candy in his tinted van. Reading my example above may have made you chuckle thinking about the child's foolishness, but how often do you not see the difference between the faithful Christian advice from a pastor and the foolish wordly advice from a coworker. We must discern a man, his words, and his purposes. Otherwise, we are still just children.</p>
  <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
  <h2>Verse 28 - A city breached, without walls / A man without self-control in spirit</h2>
  <p>The security of a city is its walls; the security of a man is his self-control. A city cannot determine the decisions of its enemies, but can reinforce its walls. So, a man will not know what sort of attacks the enemy is planning but he can resolve to remain steadfast in his loyalty to Yahweh. This is a particular danger for young men who are happy to bring in greek gifts into his city not knowing the danger hidden in them. He freely opens his city gates not discerning when to open his gates and when to fortify his walls.</p>
  <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
  <h2>Verse 7 - Both legs hang from the lame / And a proverb in the mouth of the fool</h2>
  <p>Legs are useful to the one who can use them. But for the unfortunate lame, they are a useless burden hanging from their bodies. What was intended to help transport you from one station to another has become a reminder of your inability to progress. It is no coincidence that the righteous life is described in terms of walking in wisdom, and here we see the fool's use of the proverbs compared to the lame's use of his legs. The fool may recite proverbs but is no more capable of walking down the righteous path than a man with paralyzed legs can walk down the street.</p>
  <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
  <h2>Verse 1 - Do not boast in tomorrow / For you do not know what tomorrow will bring</h2>
  <p>Like in James, this proverb is reminding us of our limitations. Do not be quick to boast in tomorrow as the boast is not grounded in truth. If one were to boast, he ought to boast in true things. As it stands, tomorrow is beyond our understanding, and only children boast of imaginary things. Instead, we ought to look at today and work (see Jesus' statement in the Sermon on the Mount).</p>
