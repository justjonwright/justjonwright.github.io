    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Everything can be categorized into two groups: true things and false things.</p>
    <p>This is the starting point. This singular idea serves as the basis for every other thought, decision, and action.</p>
    <p>If you are unsure about what I just wrote, consider that you followed this process many times to come to your uncertainty.
      First, you assumed that this text was a true thing and not some imaginary text. As a true thing, you deemed it to be worth reading.
      After reading it, you reviewed whether it made any true arguments. By comparing the statement above ("Everything can be categorized into two groups")
      with what you know to be true, you determined that the statement required further explanation before assigning it in your mind as "true."
