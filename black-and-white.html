    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>It is good to judge. This is the central tenet of the book.</p>
      <p>You know it is good to judge. In fact, you're doing it right now to every sentence you are reading. You are trying to tell if this book is something worth reading. Every new sentence adds a little more information on which you will base your judgment. You already agree with me that judging is good.</p>
      <p>But what is meant by judging? Images of courtrooms or religious apocalypse may flash in your mind, but that is not exactly what I mean when I say "It is good to judge." Those images are judgments but I mean something more basic. Judging is to designate value. So, that broken table selling for $139 that you think you can fix? You determined it is underpriced and a steal. That new cologne your coworker uses? It's horrible and should be tossed out. Both are judgments.</p>
      <p>When you start paying attention to your thoughts, you will see that you judge everything. From what Netflix show to binge, to what sounds good to eat, to who to vote for as President, you are constantly judging and choosing how to live based on those judgments. Whether you like it or not, you're a judge.</p>
      <p>This book is to help us be better judges.</p>
    <h1>Part 1: Juding Books</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1: Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover</h2>
        <p>We have all heard this advice and like most pithy sayings it is helpful but not sufficient. The purpose of the phrase above is to suggest that right judgment can't be made <em>solely</em> on aesthetics. But to say no judgment should be made based on aesthetics is bad advice. All booklovers know that a cover actually provides a lot of information regarding the book. It reveals the publishing company, the target audience, the type of writing inside, the emphasis of text versus picture, and much more. A wise judge is able to read all this meaning and value from the cover.</p>
        <p class="quote">A good judge uses all information available to determine a more accurate assessment of the thing's value. Aesthetics often reveal inner meaning.</p>
        <p>So, how should we go about judging a book? Like any right juding, it begins with making good distinctions. After distinctions are made we can then value each part and assess the sum of the thing judged.</p>
      <h2>And God Separated the Light from the Darkness</h2>
        <p>In the beginning was chaos. God organized the world by division. He separated the light from the darkness, the sky above from the waters below, the earth from the seas. This is the basis of all proper judgment.</p>
